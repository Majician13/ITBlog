        <p>Welcome back to the second part of our blog post series on Word as a tutorial for intermediate to expert users.
            In this post, we will cover some of the hotkeys and other useful tools that can help you work faster and
            smarter with Word. We will also provide a cheatsheet that you can print and keep handy for reference.</p>

        <h2>Hotkeys</h2>
        <p>Hotkeys are keyboard shortcuts that allow you to perform common tasks without using the mouse. They can save
            you time and improve your productivity. Here are some of the most useful hotkeys for Word:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Ctrl + C: Copy the selected text or object</li>
            <li>Ctrl + V: Paste the copied text or object</li>
            <li>Ctrl + X: Cut the selected text or object</li>
            <li>Ctrl + Z: Undo the last action</li>
            <li>Ctrl + Y: Redo the last action</li>
            <li>Ctrl + F: Find a word or phrase in the document</li>
            <li>Ctrl + H: Replace a word or phrase in the document</li>
            <li>Ctrl + B: Bold the selected text</li>
            <li>Ctrl + I: Italicize the selected text</li>
            <li>Ctrl + U: Underline the selected text</li>
            <li>Ctrl + L: Align the text to the left</li>
            <li>Ctrl + R: Align the text to the right</li>
            <li>Ctrl + E: Align the text to the center</li>
            <li>Ctrl + J: Justify the text</li>
            <li>Ctrl + A: Select all the text in the document</li>
            <li>Ctrl + P: Print the document</li>
            <li>F7: Check spelling and grammar</li>
            <li>F12: Save the document as a different name or format</li>
        </ul>

        <p>These are just some of the basic hotkeys that you can use in Word. There are many more that you can find in
            the Help menu or online. You can also customize your own hotkeys by going to <code>File > Options >
                Customize Ribbon > Keyboard Shortcuts</code>.</p>

        <h2>Quick Access Toolbar</h2>
        <p>Another useful tool that you can use in Word is the Quick Access Toolbar. This is a small toolbar that appears
            at the top left corner of the window, next to the Save button. It contains some of the most frequently used
            commands, such as Save, Undo, Redo, Print, etc. You can add or remove commands from this toolbar by clicking
            on the drop-down arrow and selecting More Commands. You can also move this toolbar below the ribbon by
            selecting Show Below the Ribbon.</p>

        <p>The Quick Access Toolbar is a great way to access your favorite commands with one click. You can also use Alt +
            numbers to activate them with your keyboard. For example, Alt + 1 will save your document, Alt + 2 will undo
            your last action, and so on.</p>

        <h2>Format Painter</h2>
        <p>One more tool that we want to mention is the Format Painter. This is a handy feature that allows you to copy and apply formatting from one part of your document to another. For example, if you have a heading that you want to make consistent with another heading, you can use the Format Painter to do so. To use it, select the text that has the formatting you want to copy, click on the Format Painter button on the Home tab, and then select the text that you want to apply it to. You can also double-click on the Format Painter button to keep it active until you press Esc.</p>
            
        <p>    The Format Painter can save you a lot of time and effort when you want to make your document look neat and professional. You can use it to copy font styles, colors, sizes, alignment, indentation, bullets, numbering, borders, shading, and more.</p>
